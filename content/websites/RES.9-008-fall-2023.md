course_description: "This is a seminar series led by graduate students and postdocs\
  \ in the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) from 2015 to the present,\
  \ featuring tutorials on computational topics relevant to research on intelligence\
  \ in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. These tutorials\
  \ are aimed at participants who have some computational background but are not experts\
  \ on these topics.\n\nA computational tutorial can consist of any method, tool,\
  \ or model that is broadly relevant within neuroscience, cognitive science, and\
  \ artificial intelligence. The goal is to bring researchers in brain and cognitive\
  \ sciences closer to the researchers creating computational methods.\_\n\nResources\
  \ posted here include lecture videos, lecture slides, code and datasets for exercises,\
  \ background references, and other supplementary material. Typically, each tutorial\
  \ consists of a short lecture, and an interactive part with tutorials or \"office\
  \ hours\" to work through practice problems and discuss how the material may be\
  \ applied to participants\u2019 research.\_\n\nThis series was organized by Emily\
  \ Mackevicius, Jenelle Feather, Nhat Le, Fernanda De La Torre Romo, and Greta Tuckute,\
  \ with financial support from BCS. Videos were filmed, edited, and produced by Kris\
  \ Brewer, Director of Technology at the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM)."
