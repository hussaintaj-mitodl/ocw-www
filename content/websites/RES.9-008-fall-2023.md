course_description: "Seminar series led by graduate students and postdocs in the MIT\
  \ Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) from 2015-present featuring tutorials\
  \ on computational topics relevant to research on intelligence in neuroscience,\
  \ cognitive science, and AI. Live tutorials include a lecture followed by office\
  \ hours to work through problems and discuss how the material may be applied to\
  \ participants\u2019 research.\_\n\nResources posted here include lecture videos\
  \ created by CBMM, lecture slides, code and datasets for exercises, background references,\
  \ and other supplementary material. These tutorials are aimed at graduate students\
  \ and postdocs with some computational background, but who are not experts on these\
  \ topics.\_\n\nThis series was organized by Emily Mackevicius and Jenelle Feather,\
  \ with financial support from the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.\
  \ Videos by Kris Brewer from the Center for Minds Brains and Machines."
