course_description: This course relies on primary readings from the database community
  to introduce graduate/undergraduate students to the foundations of database systems,
  focusing on basics such as the relational algebra and data model, schema normalization,
  query optimization, transactions, and other more advanced topics. No prior database
  experience is assumed, though students who have taken an undergraduate course in
  databases are encouraged to attend.
