  \ studies, an interdisciplinary academic field that explores critical questions\
  \ about the meaning of gender in society. The primary goal of this course is to\
  \ familiarize students with key issues, questions, and debates in women\u2019s and\
  \ gender studies scholarship, both historical and contemporary. Gender scholarship\

  \ individual lives and social institutions."
