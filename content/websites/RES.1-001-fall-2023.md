  \ a required course within MIT\u2019s Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering\
  \ that he designed, developed, and taught for many years. It is structured to be\
  \ of interest to anyone focused on infrastructure systems, especially engineers,\
  \ planners, and managers who design, build and operate such systems. The book may\
  \ also be of interest to students in planning or engineering who are interested\

  \nProject Evaluation: Essays and Case Studies is published in two stand-alone volumes.\
  \ Volume I provides an overview of project evaluation as a multi-dimensional process\
  \ aimed at creating projects that meet the needs of society. Volume II examines\
  \ the equivalence relationships that can be used to compare cash flows or economic\
  \ costs and benefits over the life of a project."
