course_description: "This collection of videos presents Professor Strang\u2019s updated\
  \ vision of how linear algebra could be taught.\n\nIt starts with six brief videos,\
  \ recorded in 2020, containing many ideas and suggestions about the recommended\
  \ order of topics in teaching and learning linear algebra. Topics include *A New\
  \ Way to Start Linear Algebra*, *The Column Space of a Matrix,* *The Big Picture\
  \ of Linear Algebra,* *Orthogonal Vectors,* *Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors,* and\
  \ *Singular Values and Singular Vectors.*\n\nAn additional brief video, recorded\
  \ in 2021, *Finding the Nullspace: Solving Ax = 0 by Elimination*, computes the\
  \ nullspace of any matrix *A*.\n\nIn 2023, Professor Strang recorded a new one-hour\
  \ video, *Five Factorizations of a Matrix,* providing an overall look at linear\
  \ algebra by highlighting five different ways that a matrix gets factored."
