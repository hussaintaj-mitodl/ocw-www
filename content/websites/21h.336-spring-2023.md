course_description: Through close examination of the emperor Augustus and his Julio-Claudian
  successors, this subject investigates how Roman emperors used art, architecture,
  coinage, and other media to create and project an image of themselves, how the surviving
  literary sources from the Roman period reinforced or subverted that image, and how
  both phenomena have contributed to post-classical perceptions of Roman emperors.
  It also considers works of Suetonius and Tacitus, and modern representations of
  the emperors such as those found in the films *I, Claudius*, *Quo Vadis*, and HBO's
  *Rome* series.
