course_description: "This training course is an introduction to the use of the AFNI\
  \ software suites for the analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data. It is not intended\
  \ as an introduction to how fMRI works but is aimed at people who are already doing\
  \ fMRI data analysis, or those who will be in the near future.\_\n\nAFNI (Analysis\
  \ of Functional NeuroImages) is a leading software suite of C, Python, and R programs\
  \ and shell scripts, primarily developed for the analysis and display of anatomical\
  \ and fMRI data. It is freely available for research purposes.\_\n\nThis event was\
  \ organized by the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM) Trainee Leadership\
  \ Council.\n\nCBMM is a multi-institutional NSF Science and Technology Center headquartered\
  \ at MIT that is dedicated to developing a computationally based understanding of\
  \ human intelligence and establishing an engineering practice based on that understanding.\
  \ CBMM brings together computer scientists, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists\
  \ to create a new field\u2014the science and engineering of intelligence."
