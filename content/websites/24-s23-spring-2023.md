course_description: "This seminar explored the idea that the study of linguistics\
  \ can be a means to develop young people's understanding of scientific inquiry as\
  \ well as their understanding of the nature of language. The challenge of this seminar\
  \ was to create pedagogical materials and methods that will motivate learners of\
  \ all ages to be inquisitive about their native language and about language in general.\
  \ Seminar participants worked with one another and in partnership with K\u201312\
  \ teachers to accomplish this goal."
