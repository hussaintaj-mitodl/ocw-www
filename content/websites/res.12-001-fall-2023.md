course_description: "This collection of three essays was developed from the author's\
  \ experience teaching the course *Fluid Dynamics of the Atmosphere and Ocean*, offered\
  \ to graduate students entering the [MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Oceanography](http://mit.whoi.edu/).\
  \ The essays are:\n\n1. Lagrangian and Eulerian Representations of Fluid Flow: Kinematics\
  \ and the Equations of Motion,\n2. Dimensional Analysis of Models and Data Sets:\
  \ Similarity Solutions and Scaling Analysis, and\n3. A Coriolis Tutorial\n\nThe\
  \ goal of this resource is to help each student master the concepts and mathematical\
  \ tools that make up the foundation of classical and geophysical fluid dynamics.\
  \ These essays treat these topics in considerably greater depth than a comprehensive\
  \ fluids textbook can afford, and they are accompanied by data files (MATLAB\xAE\
  \ and Fortan) that allows some application and experimentation. They should be suitable\
  \ for self-study."
