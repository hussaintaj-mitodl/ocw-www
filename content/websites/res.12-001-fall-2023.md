course_description: "This resource presents a collection of essays developed from\
  \ the author's experience teaching the course *Fluid Dynamics of the Atmosphere\
  \ and Ocean*, offered to graduate students entering the [MIT/WHOI Joint Program\
  \ in Oceanography](http://mit.whoi.edu/). The collection includes the following\
  \ three essays:\n\n**Essay 1: Lagrangian and Eulerian Representations of Fluid Flow**\
  \ (revised and expanded in 2024)\n\n- Part 1: Kinematics and the Equations of Motion\n\
  - Part 2: Advection of Parcels and Fields\n\n**Essay 2: Dimensional Analysis of\
  \ Models and Data Sets: Similarity Solutions and Scaling Analysis**\n\n**Essay 3:\
  \ A Coriolis Tutorial** (revised and expanded in 2023)\n\n- Part 1: The Coriolis\
  \ Force, Inertial and Geostrophic Motion\n- Part 2: A Rotating Shallow Water Model\
  \ and Geostrophic Adjustment\n- Part 3: Beta Effects and Western Propagation\n-\
  \ Part 4: Wind-Driven Ocean Circulation and the Sverdrup Relation\n- Part 5: On\
  \ the Seasonally-Varying Circulation of the Arabian Sea\n\nThe goal of this resource\
  \ is to help each student master the concepts and mathematical tools that make up\
  \ the foundation of classical and geophysical fluid dynamics. These essays treat\
  \ these topics in considerably greater depth than a comprehensive fluids textbook\
  \ can afford, and they are accompanied by data files (MATLAB\xAE and Fortan) to\
  \ allow some application and experimentation. They should be suitable for self-study."
