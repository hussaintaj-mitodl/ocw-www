course_description: "Our brains are remarkably adaptable throughout our lives. Individual\
  \ brain cells called neurons form synapses, sites of physical connection and communication\
  \ between neurons, and then repeatedly rewire those connections in response to new\
  \ experiences or to neuronal cell death caused by injury, disease, or aging. In\
  \ this course, we will explore how neurons establish their synapses in the healthy\
  \ brain during childhood and later in life, and how this process goes awry in disease\
  \ states. More specifically, we will discuss how the brain forms its synapses early\
  \ in life, stabilizes a subset of those synapses for long-term maintenance, and\
  \ continues to add and remove synapses throughout life. We will then explore synapse\
  \ dysfunction in diseases such as autism and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which involve\
  \ abnormal increases or losses of synaptic connections, respectively. We will also\
  \ consider synapse remodeling, a process of adding and removing synaptic connections\
  \ to optimize our brain network, in the context of neuroinflammation, recovery from\
  \ traumatic brain injury, and psychological trauma following prolonged stress.\n\
  \nThis course is one of many [Advanced Undergraduate Seminars](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/current-students/subject-offerings/advanced-undergraduate-seminars/)\
  \ offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students\
  \ with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about\
  \ current biological research in a highly interactive setting. Many instructors\
  \ of the Advanced Undergraduate Seminars are postdoctoral scientists with a strong\
  \ interest in teaching."
