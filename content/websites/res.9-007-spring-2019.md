course_description: "This series helps learners understand magnetoencephalography\
  \ (MEG) signals through the lens of source estimation, decoding, and connectivity:\
  \ principles, pitfalls, and perspectives.\n\nMEG methodological approaches have\
  \ grown remarkably during the 50-year history of MEG. A breadth of source estimation\
  \ tools can localize brain activity even in challenging situations. Pattern analysis\
  \ of brain activity can perform feats of mind reading by revealing what a person\
  \ is seeing, perceiving, attending to, or remembering. Functional connectivity approaches\
  \ can assess the role of large-scale brain networks in cognitive function. The aim\
  \ of this workshop is to deconstruct these tools, overview the challenges and limitations,\
  \ and demonstrate MEG data analysis procedures to a novice researcher.\n\nThis workshop\
  \ was sponsored by the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), a multi-institutional\
  \ NSF Science and Technology Center headquartered at MIT that is dedicated to the\
  \ study of intelligence\u2014how the brain produces intelligent behavior and how\
  \ we may be able to replicate intelligence in machines."
