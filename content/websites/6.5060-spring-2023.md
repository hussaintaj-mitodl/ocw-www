course_description: This is a research-oriented course on algorithm engineering, which
  will cover both the theory and practice of algorithms and data structures. Students
  will learn about models of computation, algorithm design and analysis, and performance
  engineering of algorithm implementations. We will study the design and implementation
  of sequential, parallel, cache-efficient, external-memory, and write-efficient algorithms
  for fundamental problems in computing. Many of the principles of algorithm engineering
  will be illustrated in the context of parallel algorithms and graph problems.
