course_description: '*Chemistry Behind the Magic* features videos of exciting live
  chemistry demonstrations. The videos are enhanced by explanations of the science
  behind the demonstration, in a fun and easy-to-understand format.


  This set of videos showcases exciting live chemistry demonstrations held at MIT.
  Through the magic of chemistry, Dr. John Dolhun and Dr. Bassam Shakhashiri create
  things that steam, fizzle, and glow. Each video also provides a deeper look into
  the chemistry that makes it all possible.


  For teachers, we have provided supporting materials to help you understand and replicate
  the experiments in your own classrooms. These videos can be watched in any order.


  **WARNING NOTICE**


  The experiments described in these materials are potentially hazardous. Among other
  things, the experiments should include the following safety measures: a high level
  of safety training, special facilities and equipment, the use of proper personal
  protective equipment, and supervision by appropriate individuals. You bear the sole
  responsibility, liability, and risk for the implementation of such safety procedures
  and measures. MIT and Dow shall have no responsibility, liability, or risk for the
