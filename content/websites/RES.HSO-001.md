course_description: 'At the [MIT Haystack Observatory](https://www.haystack.mit.edu/),
  researchers use several basic science concepts every day. Electromagnetic waves,
  optics, and molecular chemistry are just a few of the core topics that can be incorporated
  into the high school science curriculum by exploring the atmosphere and the universe
  with lessons focused around the research specialties at Haystack.


  The original material presented here was developed by teachers, with the assistance
  of the staff at Haystack. All lesson plans have been successfully used in high school
  classrooms. These lessons have been prepared with specific attention to the goals
  and objectives of current science curricula. The object is to create lessons that
  will enhance your class, not require you to add substantial material.


  The development of these educational materials at the Haystack Observatory was funded
  by the National Science Foundation under the Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)
  program.'
