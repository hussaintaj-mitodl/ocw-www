course_description: "The development of quantum field theory and string theory in\
  \ the last four decades led to an unprecedented level of interaction between physics\
  \ and mathematics, incorporating into physics such \u201Cpure\u201D areas of mathematics\
  \ as algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, representation theory, combinatorics,\
  \ and even number theory. This interaction has been highly fruitful in both directions,\
  \ and led to a necessity for physicists to know basic mathematics and for mathematicians\
  \ to know basic physics. Physicists have been quick to learn, and nowadays good\
  \ physicists know relevant areas of mathematics as deeply as professional mathematicians.\
  \ On the other hand, many mathematicians have been slower, intimidated by the absence\
  \ of rigor in physical texts, and, more importantly, by a different manner of presentation.\
  \ In particular, even the basic setting of quantum field theory, necessary for understanding\
  \ its more advanced (and mathematically exciting) parts, is already largely unfamiliar\
  \ to mathematicians. Nevertheless, many of the basic ideas of quantum field theory\
  \ can in fact be presented in a completely rigorous and mathematical way. Doing\
  \ so will be the main goal of this course."
