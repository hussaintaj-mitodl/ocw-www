course_description: "The Chandra Astrophysics Institute (CAI), a Chandra X-ray Observatory\u2013\
  sponsored program run by the [MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research](https://space.mit.edu/),\
  \ was intended for students from the Boston area from a wide range of academic backgrounds\
  \ with a limited opportunity to directly experience authentic science.\_\n\nThe\
  \ CAI was a year-long program to train for and take part in authentic astronomy\
  \ projects. Participants built employable research, technology, and collaboration\
  \ skills and the background knowledge necessary to understand how research science\
  \ is done. Investigations of different astronomical systems were undertaken during\
  \ a five-week summer session at MIT. Participants, mentored by MIT researchers and\
  \ educators, then applied these skills to undertake research projects in x-ray astronomy\
  \ based on observations made with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory."
