course_description: "Understanding the energy needs and market opportunities in the\
  \ specific off-grid community or region is the first step for effectively selecting\
  \ and implementing\_the solutions to meet a community's\_energy needs. MIT D-Lab\
  \ has developed the Energy Assessment Toolkit to guide organizations through the\
  \ process of gathering the information needed to make informed decisions about what\
  \ technologies and business models are best suited to meet the specific needs of\
  \ their community through market-based initiatives.\_\n\nThis toolkit is designed\
  \ for any organization that has an on\xAD-the\xAD-ground presence in an off\xAD\
  -grid community or region and has the ability to take action based on the opportunities\
  \ identified. This community-\xADbased assessment approach is not intended to replace\
  \ studies that track energy access on a national level or to generate market intelligence\
  \ reports for external organizations looking to expand their business or programs\
  \ into new markets."
