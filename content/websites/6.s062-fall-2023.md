course_description: "The emergence of transformer architectures in 2017 triggered\
  \ a breakthrough in machine learning that today lets anyone create computer-generated\
  \ essays, stories, pictures, music, videos, and programs from high-level prompts\
  \ in natural language, all without the need to code. That has stimulated fervent\
  \ discussion among educators about the implications of generative AI systems for\
  \ curricula and teaching methods across a broad range of subjects. It has also raised\
  \ questions of how to understand both these systems and the at times overstated\
  \ claims made for them. This class will introduce the foundations of generative\
  \ AI technology, and participants will explore new opportunities it enables for\
  \ K\u201312 education. It will also describe and explore how an analytical frame\
  \ of mind can help make clear the core issues underlying both the successes and\
  \ failures of these systems. Much of the work will be project-based, involving implementing\
  \ innovative teaching and learning tools and testing these with K\u201312 students\
  \ and teachers."
