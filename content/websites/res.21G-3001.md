course_description: "This website has been designed to offer strategies for teaching\
  \ this seminal work to intermediate-level college students in a way that is dynamic,\
  \ engaging, and perhaps most importantly highlights the connection between Madame\
  \ de Lafayette\u2019s seventeenth-century work *La Princesse de Cl\xE8ves* and the\
  \ contemporary social concerns of young people in today\u2019s world.\_\n\nThere\
  \ was a recent heated debate in France about the modern relevance of this literary\
  \ text that began when Nicolas Sarkozy suggested that the study of this text was\
  \ useless. His comments incited fervent discussion in French academic, artistic,\
  \ and political circles.\_The compelling history of the text, along with its importance\
  \ in contemporary French society and culture, makes the study of this work highly\
  \ relevant for students.\n\nThe *La Princesse de Cl\xE8ves* website is published\
