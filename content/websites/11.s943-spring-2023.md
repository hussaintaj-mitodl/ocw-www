course_description: "This course examines planning and public policy in the context\
  \ of the U.S. political economy and changing national and global policy priorities\
  \ and frameworks. The course reviews challenges to the dominant policy paradigms\
  \ of the past several decades, including neoliberalism, globalization, and industrial\
  \ strategy in the context of race, equity, sustainability, technology, and innovation.\
  \ Students will be partnered with states/cities that are grappling with some of\
  \ these questions, and will support them in developing a strategy for spending or\
  \ accessing funding. The objective of the course is to offer a grounding in the\
  \ why and how of the priorities driving today\u2019s policies, the inputs and processes\
  \ that go into developing policies, and the downstream implications for federal\
  \ policy decisions on cities and states."
