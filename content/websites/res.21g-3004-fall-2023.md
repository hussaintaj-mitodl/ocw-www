course_description: 'Recent decades have seen a sharp increase in critical interest
  in Marguerite de Navarre and her work. This society website is dedicated to the
  study of Marguerite, her network, and her historical and cultural influence. The
  main goals are to facilitate scholarly exchange, to encourage collaboration, and
  to make digital resources available to the wider community. The society seeks to
  bring together the multiple lines of inquiry which inspire our understanding and
  appreciation of Marguerite, and to inspire new ones.
