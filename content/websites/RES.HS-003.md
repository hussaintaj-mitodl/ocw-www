  \ environment through a four-week intensive January course called [*5.301 Chemistry\
  \ Lab Techniques*](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-301-chemistry-laboratory-techniques-january-iap-2012/).\
  \ The stakes are high\u2014students who pass the class are guaranteed a job in an\
  \ MIT research lab.\_\n\nOpenCourseWare documented the experience of 14 students\
  \ who took this course in January 2012. Follow their journey over 11 episodes and\
  \ watch as they struggled with, but ultimately mastered, the techniques needed to\
  \ be successful in an MIT chemistry lab.\n\n**WARNING NOTICE**\n\nThe experiments\
  \ described in these materials are potentially hazardous. Among other things, the\
  \ experiments should include the following safety measures: a high level of safety\
  \ training, special facilities and equipment, the use of proper personal protective\
