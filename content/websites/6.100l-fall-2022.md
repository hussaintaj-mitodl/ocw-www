course_description: This subject is aimed at students with little to no programming
  experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation
  can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their
  major, to feel justifiably confident in their ability to write simple programs that
  allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python 3 programming
  language.
