  \ conversation tasks for students learning Russian and English. The goal of this\
  \ pilot project is to support exchanges between students in English-speaking and\
  \ Russian-speaking countries.\_\n\nThe conversation topics included are aligned\
  \ with common college-level Russian language curricula, grouped by levels defined\
  \ by [ACTFL proficiency standards,](https://www.actfl.org/educator-resources/actfl-proficiency-guidelines)\
  \ and utilize [OPI (Oral Proficiency Interview)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.actfl.org%2Fassessment-research-and-development%2Factfl-assessments%2Factfl-postsecondary-assessments%2Foral-proficiency-interview-opi&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw05z0FmOdGnG_aPpL0kTFix)\
  \ practices. Topics include vocabulary, questions, and interactive activities that\
