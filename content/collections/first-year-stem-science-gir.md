description: "Some of OCW\u2019s most widely used courses are introductions to science\
  \ and math, which together form MIT's [Science Core](https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/general-institute-requirements-girs/science-core/).\
  \ These foundational subjects in calculus, physics, chemistry, and biology are a\
  \ key part of MIT\u2019s [General Institute Requirements (GIR)](https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/general-institute-requirements-girs/)\
  \ for all undergraduate students.\n\nMIT offers several related but varied treatments\
  \ of each subject, in order to match the learner's particular interests and level\
  \ of preparation. There is more than one way to learn these key concepts, for instance\
  \ with differing emphasis on theory or on real-world applications, and so OCW shares\
  \ some of the varied treatments offered at MIT.\n\n**Mathematics**\n\nThe Mathematics\
  \ GIR is a sequence of two subjects, Single Variable Calculus and Multivariable\
  \ Calculus, as described in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdd-TyWGYrs).\n\
  \nMost MIT students take the standard versions of these subjects, 18.01 and 18.02,\
  \ such as the following:\n\n- [18.01SC Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/)\n\
  - [18.02SC Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/)\n\
  \nOther versions of [Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Mathematics&q=18.01)\
  \ and [Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Mathematics&q=18.02)\
  \ are also available on OCW.\_\n\n**Physics**\n\nThe Physics GIR is a sequence of\
  \ two subjects, Classical Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism, as described\
  \ [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0r3MpHd_mU).\n\nMost MIT students\
  \ take the standard versions of these courses, 8.01 and 8.02, such as the following:\n\
  \n- [8.01SC Physics I: Classical Mechanics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/)\n\
  - [8.02 Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2019/)\n\
  \nOther versions of [Classical Mechanics](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Physics&q=8.01)\
  \ and [Electricity and Magnetism](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Physics&q=8.02)\
  \ are also available on OCW.\n\n**Chemistry**\n\nAny one of three subjects satisfies\
  \ the Chemistry GIR, as described [in this video](https://youtu.be/ljxssJgODlE).\n\
  \nThe Department of Chemistry offers two versions:\n\n- [5.111SC Principles of Chemical\
  \ Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-111sc-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2014/)\n\
  - [5.112 Principles of Chemical Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/5-112-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2005/)\
  \ for students with more advanced background (e.g., two years of high school chemistry)\n\
  \nThe Department of Materials Science and Engineering offers the following version:\_\
  \n\n- [3.091 Introduction to Solid State Chemistry](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/3-091-introduction-to-solid-state-chemistry-fall-2018/),\
  \ which assumes some background in high school chemistry and emphasizes the application\
  \ of chemistry in materials.\n\n**Biology**\n\nThe Biology GIR, Introductory Biology,\
  \ is described in [this video](https://youtu.be/7ecTUbUOiFw).\_\n\nIntroductory\
  \ Biology comes in several versions numbered 7.012 through 7.016. All versions cover\
  \ a common core of topics, as well as distinctive material in each version as described\
  \ in the [Biology GIR subject options list](https://biology.mit.edu/undergraduate/major-minor-requirements/general-institute-requirement/).\n\
  \n- [7.01SC Fundamentals of Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-01sc-fundamentals-of-biology-fall-2011/)\
  \ is a single course representation created by OCW using selections from several\
  \ Biology GIR versions.\n\nOther versions of [Introductory Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Biology&q=7.01&s=department_course_numbers.sort_coursenum)\
  \ are also available on OCW.\n\nIncoming students may prepare for Introductory Biology\
  \ with the online non-credit course [Pre-7.01: Getting up to Speed in Biology](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/res-7-001-pre-7-01-getting-up-to-speed-in-biology-summer-2019/)."
