description: "Like so many of the big challenges taken on at MIT, environmental and\
  \ sustainability issues demand an interdisciplinary perspective.\n\nFrom declining\
  \ fisheries to acute urban pollution to record-breaking global temperatures, the\
  \ evidence of human impact on the environment continues to mount. And at the same\
  \ time, the environment shapes us, as human society and institutions are built upon\
  \ our connection to the weather, land, water, and other species. What can we learn\
  \ from ecological systems and cycles? What solutions will allow people and the planet\
  \ to thrive?\_\n\nMIT scholars, students and alumni are working to understand and\
  \ help us make progress toward a more sustainable and just world. This core mission\
  \ draws upon all of the fields represented at MIT: not just science, engineering,\
  \ and technology, but also the humanities, arts, economics, history, architecture,\
  \ urban planning, management, policy, and more.\n\nThis OCW course collection is\
  \ inspired by two interdisciplinary MIT programs. Many of the undergraduate courses\
  \ fall within the [undergraduate Environment and Sustainability Minor](http://environmentalsolutions.mit.edu/environment-sustainability-minor/)\
  \ managed by MIT\u2019s Environmental Solutions Initiative (ESI); the OCW course\
  \ list employs the undergraduate minor\u2019s four topic pillars. Many of the graduate-level\
  \ courses are part of the\_[MIT Sloan School of Management Sustainability Certificate](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/sustainability/sustainability-certificate)\
  \ curriculum.\n\nAlso check out the [MIT Climate Portal](https://climate.mit.edu)\
  \ for many other Creative Commons-licensed open educational resources on climate\
  \ change, including brief Explainer articles on key topics and the award-winning\
  \ TILClimate podcast with educator guides."
